# Human-Centered-Machine-Learning

In this project, I will form hypotheses about how the composition of a dataset impacts
performance of a classifier for subgroups within a larger population. I will then conduct
experiments to test my hypotheses. Finally, I will draw conclusions about the implications of
any observed performance differences between subgroups.

I will be working with the UTKFace dataset , which can be used to train a classifier to predict
a personâ€™s age, gender, and race from a photo of their face. This dataset can be found at Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/jangedoo/utkface-new or in this link https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/
