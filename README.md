# Human-Centered-Machine-Learning

In this project, I have formed hypotheses about how the composition of a dataset impacts
performance of a classifier for subgroups within a larger population. Then I conducted
experiments to test my hypotheses. Finally, I have discussed the implications of
some observed performance differences between subgroups.

I worked with the UTKFace dataset , which could be used to train a classifier to predict
a personâ€™s age, gender, and race from a photo of their face. This dataset can be found at Kaggle
